    <textOnly>Dear {!litify_pm__Intake__c.litify_pm__Client__c},
You recently contacted our Firm about bringing a lawsuit to recover compensation for injuries you suffered. We sent you certain forms to complete and return to us in order to enable us to begin representing you and advocating on your behalf. We have not yet received that material from you, so we thought we would reach out to you to ask whether you are still interested in pursuing your claim with us on your side.

When you get this letter, please call us immediately to let us know when we might expect your completed forms—or just to discuss further how we can help you.

Please be advised that your time to take legal action is not unlimited. The clock might be running already. If you fail to return the completed forms to our office immediately, your ability to pursue any claim you may have in this regard, may become TIME BARRED AND LOST FOREVER!

If there is anything at all we can explain about the process of making a claim for compensation—and how we make that process as painless as possible—please do not hesitate to call us.
